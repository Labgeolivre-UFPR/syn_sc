qgisMinimumVersion=3.22
description=Generate high-volume synthetic point data with user-defined continuity & smoothness
version=0.1
about=Syn-SC is a QGIS Processing provider that synthesises realistic point data for perceptual user studies, AI training and teaching. It controls three spatial parameters independently: continuity (proportion of empty grid cells), smoothness (mean absolute contrast between neighbouring cells) and an optional point-per-cell cap.  A Scale Assistant builds an adaptive hexagon grid and suggests the optimum solver (Brute, Heuristic or Iterative).  A metric evaluator verifies that the output meets the requested targets.
